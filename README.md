===========

I'm sitting in Elmhurst on UP-W train #38 at 9:05 a.m. on a
Tuesday.

I've got a meeting at 9:45 in the loop.

Will I make it on time?

The goal of this project is to answer specifically that question. This
works by periodically pulling data from Metra's
[Rail Time Tracker](https://metrarail.com/metra/wap/en/home/RailTimeTracker.html)
to determine the historical record of on-time performance and using it
to estimate when you are likely to arrive at your destination.

The data visualization takes inspiration from
[Marey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey)'s train
visualizations from Paris to Lyon in his book
[La MÃ©thode Graphique](https://archive.org/details/lamthodegraphiq00maregoog):

The idea is that these simple lines can show you how likely you are to
"make up time" and possibly make your meeting.
