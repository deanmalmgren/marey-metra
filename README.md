I'm sitting in Elmhurst on UP-W train #38 at 9:05 a.m. on a
Tuesday.

I've got a meeting at 9:45 in the loop.

I wonder, *will I make it on time?*

back story
==========

The goal of this project is to make it easy for Metra riders (and
especially myself, because I seem to always be cutting it close) to
determine whether they are going to be on time. This works by
periodically pulling data from Metra's
[Rail Time Tracker](https://metrarail.com/metra/wap/en/home/RailTimeTracker.html)
to determine the historical record of on-time performance and using it
to estimate when you are likely to arrive at your destination.

The data visualization takes inspiration from
[Marey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Jules_Marey)'s train
visualizations from Paris to Lyon in his book
[La MÃ©thode Graphique](https://archive.org/details/lamthodegraphiq00maregoog):

The idea is that these simple lines can show you how likely you are to
"make up time" and possibly make your meeting.

I was
[originally hesitant](https://twitter.com/deanmalmgren/status/455709231614681088)
to download this information in this way and I tried to obtain this
information by
[a FOIA request on 2014 April 17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyaIARPyksTUERpBNvef9PU_6XgC3keSUk9LmqrEBBc/edit?usp=sharing). Unfortunately,
[Metra only maintains arrival / departure records for 30 days](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByojUCBHn7gJT1JvTGhKOWNaa1k/view?usp=sharing),
which isn't going to provide the kinds of statistics and up-to-date
information I'd like to have. For example, if construction starts or
stops on a particular line, I'd like those delays to be incorporated
into my estimated arrival. As a result, I've resorted to the original
idea of just scraping the Rail Time Tracker system in a relatively
polite way with the hopes that I can subsequently make this data
available to others, possibly via the
[Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) or a
[Fusion Table](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232).

want to contribute?
===================

1. Clone this repository

2. Install virtualenvwrapper and make sure to [properly setup your ~/.bashrc](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#shell-startup-file)

   ```bash
   sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
   ```

   ```bash
   # add this to the end of your ~/.bashrc
   WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
   mkdir -p ${WORKON_HOME}
   vew=/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
   if [ -e ${vew} ]; then
       source ${vew}
   fi
   ```
   Then source your ```.bashrc``` file.

3. Create a python virtualenv in OSX and install all the necessary
   packages for provisioning / deploying with fabric:

   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv marey-metra
   pip install -r requirements/python-host
   ```

4. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/downloads) and
   [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and launch
   the development virtual machine:

   ```bash
   vagrant plugin install iniparse
   vagrant up && fab dev provision
   ```

notes on the development stack
==============================

* Provisioning is based off of @gabegaster's [fabtools
  startkit](https://github.com/gabegaster/FabTools_StartKit) using
  [fabtools](https://github.com/ronnix/fabtools).

* Django project setup is based off of @xenith's [django base
  template](https://github.com/xenith/django-base-template), which incorporates
  a lot of good default behaviors out of the box.

related work
============

In the process of putting this project together, I stumbled across [a
visualization of the Boston transit system](http://mbtaviz.github.io/). This
analysis is intended to show the relationship between passenger flows and train
delays but has some similar elements. This does not necessarily make it obvious
for end users how late (or early) they will be to meetings.
